# project-churn

## project description with goals

For this project, Telco is a telecommunications company and they have requested our help to identify drivers for customer churn. They have provided me with a database (Codeup's DS telco_churn db) to facilitate this task. I will construct 3 ML classification models and at the end, pick the one that most accurately predicts customer churn based on the data provided. 

### Project Goals:
- Identify key drivers for customer churn
- Use drivers to develop a ML model that accurately predicts whether a customer has churned
- Provide Telco with key customer insights
- Provide at least one business recommendation which Telco can use to meet their business objectives


## Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas

- My initial hypotheses is that customer churn is dependent on the monthly charges, type of internet service, and bundled services, and promotions.

## project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline)

### Aquire data from Codeup DS telco_churn db

### Prepare data

Identify null values (if there are, explain how I handled null values)
Create Engineered columns from existing data:
bundled (if a customer has multiple products or product features)

### Explore data
Explore data in search of drivers of churn

Answer the following initial questions:
Do monthly charges effect customer churn?
Does internet service type effect customer churn?
Does having bundled services effect customer churn?
Does tenure effect customer churn?
Does contract type effect customer churn?
Does age effect customer churn?
Develop a Model to predict if a customer will churn based on key drivers.

Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
Evaluate models on train and validate data
Select the best model based on highest accuracy
Evaluate the best model on test data
Draw conclusions
